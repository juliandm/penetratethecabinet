        "description": "Charlotte Karam is an associate professor and scholar-activist. Her research broadly examines responsible engagement of organizations and employees within the context of developing economies. With the aim of building more inclusive business and management models, both in theory and practice, Charlotte\u2019s current work focuses on women and other marginalized groups and adopts a multilevel lens embedded largely within the context of patriarchy, cultural variations, and sociopolitical instability. Interested in power dynamics and logics, her research draws from and informs the overlapping conversations about managing organizational behavior, HR/HRD, business, and public policy. Key concepts she examines include \u2013 development-oriented CSR and women\u2019s career patterns and opportunities; sexual harassment; influence ethics; and cultural variations in work-related beliefs. Charlotte\u2019s publications appear in the International J. of Management Reviews, J. of World Business, J. of Business Ethics, Business Ethics Quarterly, Business & Society, Asia-Pacific J. of Management, Career Development International, and others. Through her activism, Charlotte works to build multi-stakeholder collaborations in support of more inclusive workplaces, such as the Knowledge is Power (KIP) Project that focuses on combatting sexual harassment and other forms of exclusion from workplace and the workforce. KIP was recognized as one of AACSB 2018 Innovations that Inspire. Charlotte is often invited to speak about the work that she does at the intersection of research and activism, such as at the European Group of Organizational Studies (sub-plenary), the Academy of Management (PDW), the Arab Centre for Scientific Research and Humane Studies in Morocco (panelist), and in international media outlets (e.g., CNN). Finally, Charlotte serves as an Area Editor at the Journal of Business Ethics and as an Associate Editor at Business Ethics: European Review. She also is an executive board member of the Arab Foundation for Freedoms and Equality.\n\n\nEDUCATION \nUniversity of Windsor, Canada:  PhD in Applied Social Psychology, emphasis in Industrial/Organizational Psychology\t2008\n\nUniversity of Windsor, Canada:  MA in Applied Social Psychology, emphasis in Industrial/Organizational Psychology\t2002\n\nAmerican University of Beirut, Lebanon BA in Psychology, graduated with Honors\t1998\n\n\nACADEMIC POSITIONS\nOlayan School of Business, American University of Beirut\n\uf0a7\tAssociate Professor      2015-pres\n\uf0a7\tAssistant Professor\t      2018-15\n\n\nLEADERSHIP POSITIONS AT OSB\nAssociate Dean of Programs \t    2016-18\nChair (Convener): Management, Marketing and Entrepreneurship  Track      2015-16\nDirector, Knowledge is Power (KIP) Project on Gender and Sexuality       2015-16\n\n\nINTERNATIONAL VISITING RESEARCHER POSITIONS\nIsenberg School of Business, Univ. of Massachusetts- Amherst      2018-pres\nVisiting Professor for 1-year sabbatical \n\nFive College Women's Studies Research Center- Mt.
