He has developed microfluidic methods to create emulsions that consist of droplets of very precise and consistent sizes and to manipulate the processing and contents of individual droplets in different ways. The droplets are used to create micro-compartments, which can be loaded with single cells and other active materials, such as drugs, nutrients, and assay reagents. By chaining together different microdevice components, the droplets can be used as tiny \"test tubes\" for performing chemical and biological reactions. This allows multiple, independent reactions to take place at the rate of thousands per second, while using minuscule amounts of total reagent. Adam is using this approach for directed evolution, genetic sequencing, and cell sorting."

These tools are typically developed and tested in partnership with decision-makers and stakeholders in government, the private sector and civil society.\n\nPrior to this, Alison worked for 20 years as a consultant specialising in energy, transport, waste management and climate policy. She is particularly interested in the synergies and trade-offs between these different sectors, and how we can achieve better outcomes by looking at the whole system. For example, she wrote a book which showed the many benefits of climate action for air quality, food and energy security and economic development - but also the potential trade-offs associated with some low-carbon options. By looking at the big picture, we can find options that offer multiple benefits and minimise trade-offs."

Anne-Karine dreamed of becoming a film director but kept running into fundraising problems. She later became a stock trader but grew increasingly uneasy trying to balance work and family life. In 1991, she left her job and moved out of Paris to a small town where she created a childcare agency, quickly discovering the difficulties faced by parents working non-traditional hours. Their needs neither corresponded to the hours offered by childcare services nor the prices they could afford. Bolstered by this realization, Anne-Karine created Optimomes in 1996."

        "description": "Dr. Araceli Venegas-Gomez spent several years working for Airbus in Germany and France as an aerospace engineer, before falling in love with quantum mechanics. She then decided to follow her passion for physics, and moved to Scotland to pursue a PhD in quantum simulation at the University of Strathclyde. Following discussions with the different quantum stakeholders she had over the last years, Araceli identified the need to bridge the gap between businesses and academia, as well as to raise the quantum awareness to the general public. Continuing her work on outreach advocating quantum technologies, she was named the \u201cquantum ambassador\u201d, after winning the Optical Society Milton and Rosalind Chang Pivoting fellowship in 2019. Araceli founded her own company called QURECA (Quantum Resources and Careers) to create a link between the different stakeholders in the quantum community through a common language, and to generate global opportunities with quantum technologies. QURECA provides a range of professional services, business development, and the solution to the quantum workforce skills bottleneck: the first online platform for quantum training and resourcing, to support individuals and businesses to be part of the quantum revolution."

However, she became enamoured with emerging markets and looked to use entrepreneurial thinking to solve problems in African markets. That work has gained her recognition by both Oxford and Harvard University's Business Schools as an innovator in African entrepreneurship based on her philosophy of engaging organisations in market-making practices. She currently works with clients to help them own and successfully operate as much of their impact and value chain as possible, for the benefit of African communities."

Under her leadership, in 2003, the foundation moved out of its exhibition spaces in Palazzo Trussardi alla Scala to bring contemporary art directly into the city, venturing into fomerly unexplored territory. Like a nomadic museum, the Fondazione Nicola Trussardi conceives, organizes and produces major contemporary art exhibitions by internationally renowned artists which are created specifically for forgotten and often inaccessible buildings, monuments, and landmarks around Milan, reopening them and restoring them to the city and to art lovers. Since 2003, the Fondazione Nicola Trussardi has evolved into a unique institutional model that is admired around the world. The artists who have been presented by the Fondazione Nicola Trussardi include\u2014among others\u2014Maurizio Cattelan, Tacita Dean, Urs Fischer, Fischli and Weiss, Paul McCarthy, Pipilotti Rist, Tino Sehgal and Allora & Calzadilla.\nIn 2015 the Fondazione Nicola Trussardi has conceived and produced the exhibition The Great Mother, curated by Massimiliano Gioni, which analyzed the iconography and representation of motherhood in twentieth-century art, from the avant-garde movements to the present, through over 400 works by 139 international artists, writers and filmmakers, along with documents and other artifacts\u2014on loan from some twenty museums around the world, as well as foundations, archives, private collections and galleries\u2014in an exhibition layout that covered about 2000 square meters (20,000 square feet), stretching through 29 rooms on the middle floor of Palazzo Reale.\nIn recognition of the Fondazione Nicola Trussardi\u2019s work, Beatrice Trussardi received the Premio ICE \u2013 Impresa & Cultura in 2003. In 2004, she won the prestigious Montblanc Arts Patronage Award, an international prize assigned each year to new supporters of art and culture, and in 2012, received the Piazza Mercanti award from the Milan Chamber of Commerce for cultural philanthropy. \n \nParallel to this, Beatrice Trussardi holds positions of great prestige and responsibility in national and international organizations, bringing to bear the experience she has acquired in both the business and the cultural world.\n \nIn 2012, the Italian Minister of Cultural Heritage and Activities appointed her to the Board of MAXXI - Museo Nazionale delle Arti del XXI Secolo in Rome, due to her professional achievements and experience in the field of contemporary art and patronage.\nSince 2014 she is member of the Board of Comitato Fondazioni Italiane Arte Contemporanea, which aims to develop and make available a set of vocations and skills that Foundations of contemporary art guarantee in the field of exhibitions and research.\nSince 2009 Beatrice Trussardi has been President of the Friends of Aspen at Aspen Institute Italy, whose aim is to analyze and discuss important economic, social, and cultural issues that are fundamental to development. \nSince 2007 she has been on the Women\u2019s Leadership Board of the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts, which works to expand the role of women at every level of society through the contribution of international leaders. \nBeatrice Trussardi is Alumna Young Global Leader at World Economic Forum.\nFrom 2013 to 2015, at the invitation of the Italian Minister of Foreign Affairs, she joined the International Board of the Women in Diplomacy Committee.\n \nFrom 1999 to 2014, she held various positions and responsibilities\u2014including those of President and CEO\u2014within Trussardi Group. Her innovative business philosophy has helped make Trussardi Group a leading player on the international scene, as well as a symbol of the quality, creativity, history, and future of Italian fashion.

He left England 20 years ago and has been \u2018on the road ever since,\u2019 accumulating a unique international perspective to advise leaders on where the world might be heading.\n\nHe is a member of the faculty of Futur/io, the European Institute of Exponential Technologies & Desirable Futures, a member of the Global Future Council on Computing at the World Economic Forum, and a futurist with the UN\u2019s Resilience Frontiers initiative. This year he launched a new unconference series called Future Explorers.\n\nKnown for his ability to forecast cycles or paradigm shifts in financial markets, society, technology and geo-politics, Benjamin has been a trusted sounding board and advisor for many leaders, coaching them through uncertainty in both their business and life; and to cultivate a futurist mindset.\n\nPreviously he worked in international investment looking at trends and patterns in the world economy and human affairs, working at various investment banks, hedge funds, and also writing the International Column at Dow Theory Letters with Wall Street legend Richard Russell who started it in 1958.\n\nAmong others, Benjamin worked for Nomura Securities for 5 years as a Senior Executive. He was Executive Director at UBS and Managing Partner at Mind Fund. In 2011, he became strategist and advisor for the CIO of a global Macro Hedge Fund and his personal Family Office on the deployment of capital globally from currencies and private equity to stocks.\n\nBenjamin earned his Master\u2019s Degree in Arts in 2016 in Holistic Science from Schumacher College with his Dissertation on new approaches to future thinking: quantum theory and futurism. He earned his Bachelor\u2019s Degree of Arts in 1999 in Japanese and Economics at the School of Oriental and African Studies, at the University of London. He also attended King\u2019s College London, Columbia Business School at Columbia University, and The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology.\n\nOne of Benjamin\u2019s recent passions has been the pursuit of the Holy Grail of creativity and the quest for self-realisation. In addition to a period of investing in Silicon Valley, he spent a number of years travelling around the world meeting visionaries, entrepreneurs, creatives, martial artists, and even Zen Masters and Himalayan Oracles (!), with the goal of discerning states of mind that lead to insight. He believes that the harnessing of collective intelligence will result in a new form of Enlightenment.\n\nHe has given keynote talks at international conferences such as the World Knowledge Forum, MIPIM, the Asia Pacific Financial Forum, the Chinese government on the future of finance at the Tianfu Financial Forum, and the UN\u2019s Resilience Frontiers. He holds a BA in Economics and Japanese from SOAS, University of London and an MSc from Schumacher College, with a dissertation focused on new scientific approaches to futurism. He has also read law at Kings College London and Investment Management at Hong Kong University of Science and Technology. His book, \u201cThe Futurist\u201d is due out this year; a very human-centred dialogue about the future.\n\nBenjamin has lived in Asia for 20 years, speaks Japanese, and is a student of Chinese philosophy. He is based out of Hong Kong and has worked extensively in Asia."

        "description": "With entrepreneurship running in her blood, Caroline has always been seeking the next big innovative challenge. As a young Canadian lawyer fresh out of McGill Law School, Caroline took the leap in moving to Asia in 1998 and has spent her life becoming an expert in Asian law with the goal to demystify Asia to SMEs and PE firms from the Western part of the world and contribute to their expansion in Asia.\n \nIt wasn\u2019t long before she became the go-to source for people and SMEs and PE firms who want to understand how to grow the Asian market and navigate the Asian legal landscape successfully.\n \nToday, she has an established reputation in the international business community as an entrepreneur of 5 start up over the last 2 decades and an expert advisor on M&A cross-border transactions, commercial law, technology transfer and intellectual property matters and has been the managing director of HJM Asia Law for the past 16 years.\n \nIn Caroline\u2019s life, the only constant is growth.\n \nShe convinced her younger brother, Maxime, a trained industrial engineer, to join her in China in 2005 when they founded their first business, Jade & Co, a consulting firm for SMEs expanding in Asia offering engineering, legal, marketing and accounting services.\n \nLater, in 2007, Caroline and Maxime founded AsiaTech QC, an automated quality control platform for engineering products manufactured in China, and significantly grew the value of the company, leading to its acquisition in 2013.\n \nIn 2010, the duo started Komaspec who is now a leading manufacturer of high-end metal and plastic industrial products based in Guangzhou, China. Today, the company boasts three state-of-the-art smart manufacturing facilities, employs 200+ workers, and serves more than 100 customers in more than 25 countries worldwide, recording 30% YoY growth with a turnover of more than USD 17 millions in 2022. At present, Caroline acts as board member of Komaspec.\n \nA few years later, in 2016, she combined her entrepreneurial background with legal expertise, to bring to market ProsocecAsia, an innovative company providing secretarial, accounting, and compliance services for SMEs companies alongside an automated platform for compliance.\n \nIn 2015, she was named a Young Global Leader by the World Economic Forum and became a member of YPO in 2021.\n \nUnderstanding the role of not just mentorship, but sponsors in achieving entrepreneurial success, Caroline set up her own non profit organisation in 2016. The Young E3 Entrepreneur Fund inspires and supports a new generation of young entrepreneurs between 16 and 25 years old, by connecting them with industry experts and sponsors who can help them build a strong foundation for business success. She raises funds to finance these projects through her runs and many other initiatives.\n \nViewing growth and knowledge sharing as two parts of the same equation, Caroline is a regular speaker at international conferences and has been a visiting professor at Universit\u00e9 Laval (Canada), Bocconi University, and the Sorbonne Assas Law School. She has authored the practical book \"Doing Business in China\" published in French and English, and has been featured in numerous magazines and newspapers, including Bloomberg, the Straits Times, the Business Times, Les Affaires, and La Presse.\n \nShe remains an active member of the international business community, sitting on multiple boards of listed and private companies, the Canadian Chamber of Commerce (President), the South Africa Chamber of Commerce in Singapore, the China Working Group of the International Bar Association, and is the appointed legal adviser of the Italian Chamber of Commerce in Singapore. She is an independent director of Savaria (sis.to), a listed Canadian company in the mobility industry."
